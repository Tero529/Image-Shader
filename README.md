Image-Shader
============

Mixed-radix, two dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) for mobile GPU (OpenGL ES 2.0) written in C++. It is built on a set of functional combinators for chaining image transformations from the CPU or GPU. Currently I'm only testing this on an iPhone 5. It may work on an iPhone 4s/iPad 2 or better.

If you have any intentions of using this code I would recommend contacting me personally for support. It will help me prioritize what to write for documentation.

I am writing this module to be used in my Birch Note product (www.birchnote.com) to improve quality and performance.
