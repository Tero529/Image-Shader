Image-Shader
============

Mixed radix two dimensional fast Fourier transform for mobile (OpenGL ES 2.0). Includes rudimentary monadic "shader combinators" for pipelining shader/geometry pairs. Currently I'm only testing this on an iPhone 5. It may work on an iPhone 4s/iPad 2 or better.

If you have any intentions of using this code I would recommend contacting me personally for support.
